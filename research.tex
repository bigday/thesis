\section{Getting point cloud data}

% TODO: explain RGB-D
% TODO: avoid using an abbreviation altogether?

The OpenNI library \citep{OpenNI}
was used for data acquisition. The actual sensor used was Microsoft Kinect.

\section{Body part segmentation}

Before any attempts at human body reconstruction can be made, the body needs to be detected from the RGB-D image. 

The NITE middleware for OpenNI \citep{NITE}
includes functions for person detection. Moreover, NITE has the capability to generate a skeleton representation of human users.

As the skeleton representation is available, it was used to aid in recosntructing the body model.

Using the skeleton data, we segment the point cloud according to body parts.

The body parts used were chosen according to what the NITE skeleton allowed. Thus the following segments were used:

legs, feet, forearms, shoulders, head, torso, hip}

\section{Point cloud alignment}

The na√Øve approach to modeling uses data only from a single frame. However, this is unsatisfactory as in practice only less than a half (e.g. the front part) of a human can be seen at once. Another consideration is that the data tends to be noisy and inaccurate. Accumulating data over time makes it possible to remove some of the noise and improve accuracy.

To allow for combining data from multiple frames, the observations (point clouds) need to be aligned one way or another. Methods introduced in \autoref{literature.alignment} were available, each with their own trade-offs.

\section{Mesh generation}

\fixme{Alternative approaches, including the following}

\subsection{Voxel grid}

One possible approach is to use a voxel grid not unlike the one Kinect Fusion \citep{} uses. This allows generating meshes representing arbitrary shapes.

\subsection{Parametric surfaces}

Another approach is to use the information readily available about the body parts being modeled. Instead of allowing arbitrary shapes, the space of possible shapes can be limited to what the body parts tend to look like.
