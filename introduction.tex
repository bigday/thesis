\chapter{Introduction}

\fixme{Background:} Depth cameras have recently become cheap and widely available. While the technology is old, there were no consumer devices before Microsoft introduced their Kinect for Xbox 360. Kinect contains a normal camera for visible light, but also includes an IR camera and a laser emitter for depth measurements. \fixme{The time-of-flight technology}

Originally, Kinect was only supported for Xbox 360. However, hobbyists quickly began projects to connect the Kinect to a PC. The API was soon reverse engineered. Later on Microsoft released an SDK to the public, allowing people to experiment with Kinect on a Windows PC.

Afterwards, other similar sensors were released. \fixme{Asus Xtion Pro, what else}

\fixme{TODO: explain the problem we're trying to solve here}
Cheap depth cameras can already be used for 3D scanning static objects at home. However, to date there has been no software available for scanning moving objects. There's no fundamental reason why this can't be done. Perhaps the most interesting moving thing that people would like to scan is people. The possibility to create a 3D model of oneself is intriguing. It also would have an enormous amount of applications, same as ordinary photography.

\fixme{TODO: make explicit constraints, i.e. formulate the problem accurately. Present a research question.}

\fixme{Is it possible to generate a 3D model of the user in real time, using Microsoft Kinect and a consumer PC?}
