% Hyperref
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% Hyperref creates links from URLs, for references, and creates a
% TOC in the PDF file.
% This package must be the last one you include, because it has
% compatibility issues with many other packages and it fixes
% those issues when it is loaded.   
\RequirePackage{hyperref}
% Setup hyperref so that links are clickable but do not look 
% different

\hypersetup{bookmarksnumbered=true}
% The following line suggests the PDF reader that it should show the 
% first level of bookmarks opened in the hierarchical bookmark view. 
\hypersetup{bookmarksopen=true,bookmarksopenlevel=1}
% Hyperref can also set up the PDF metadata fields. These are
% set a bit later on, after the thesis setup.   

% Thesis setup

Depictions of humans have been made for thousands of years. As technology has progressed, new ways of replicating the human form visually have become available. Currently, virtual 3D characters can be created, but making them requires a lot of skill and effort.

Depth cameras have become cheap and are growing commonplace. This makes 3D scanning at home possible. Software for scanning static objects is already available. However, reconstructing a moving human is difficult. Previously suggested methods are slow and no implementation has been made public.

We research possible methods for automatically generating a 3D model that looks similar to the user and can be animated. We do this using a consumer depth camera that is used to track a freely moving user. We also attempt to produce an implementation that works in real-time on a high-end home computer. 

The accomplishments of this thesis are threefold. First, we review related work and existing methods and identify relevant areas of research. Secondly, different feasible approaches are planned and tried, and both their benefits and disadvantages are discussed. We show what different choices can be made in regard to building a reconstruction system, and what problems must be solved. Finally, we create some useful prototype implementations, while we fall short of a complete automatic reconstruction system.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I wish to thank the Department of Media Technology at Aalto University School of Science, which employed me to conduct this research and write a thesis. I'm especially grateful to my supervisor Tapio Takala and my instructor Tuukka Takala. I was also happy to work with Klaus Förger, Mikael Matveinen, Meeri Mäkäräinen and Roberto Pugliese in TUAS room 2550.

During this work, the greatest support has come from my wife Katri---helping me relax and get my mind off work in my free time. I love you.

Others I'd like to express my gratitude include my mother and father and extended family for bringing me this far; the people at Ristin kilta for being friends to me; the Källi brothers Sakari Pekka Paavali, Juho Arvi Samuel and Jussi Chafa Pappa for all the fun that always kept me sane; Johannes Haataja for helping me understand academia and laughing with me, not at me; and all my friends and all the people who have supported me in the past 26 years. I'm sorry that I can't mention every one of you.

Finally, I'm in an inexpressible and incomprehensible debt to my savior Jesus Christ, who has died for my sins and always loved me no matter how much sorrow I have caused Him.
