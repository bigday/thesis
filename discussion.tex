    TODO: review the best/chosen approach step by step \\
    - kinect data via openni \\
    - user segmentation by NITE \\
    - body part segmentation (nearest neighbor bone) \\
    - automatic measurements on bones and body parts \\
    - ??? \\
    - makehuman measurement plugin \\

\section{Future work}

\section{Conclusion}

\fixme{ \\
    We achieved \\
    - a general understanding of the subject matter \\
    - a practical division to sub-tasks \\
    - implementations to some sub-tasks, along with ideas to improve them \\
    - requirements for the missing implementations \\
}

\fixme{ \\
    The research failed to meet original goals. Reasons: \\
    - difficulty underestimated \\
    - no previous knowledge of the subject matter \\
    - little expertise in relevant areas in the department \\
    - lack of instruction \\
    - workload more suitable for doctoral than MSc work \\
}

\fixme{ \\
    Difficulty in scoping, reasons: \\
    - broad area of research (broad expertise needed for any task) \\
    - no big picture when starting \\
    - difficulties understanding relations between topics and their relevancy \\
    - ideas wildly branching in different directions \\
    - no feasibility validation for ideas \\
    - objective not clearly defined \\
