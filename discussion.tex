\chapter{Discussion}
% TODO: reflect on the work done; analyze the choices made etc. as objectively
% as possible

In this chapter, we discuss the work completed towards reconstructing a 3D mesh of the human body and outline suggestions for making a comprehensive implementation. We also analyze the choices made and the operability of different parts of the system. Finally, we conclude by reviewing the major achievements of this thesis, while examining problems in planning and conducting the research.

    TODO: review the best/chosen approach step by step \\
    - kinect data via openni \\
    - user segmentation by NITE \\
    - body part segmentation (nearest neighbor bone) \\
    - automatic measurements on bones and body parts \\

\section{Future work}

\section{Conclusion}

\fixme{ \\
    We achieved \\
    - a general understanding of the subject matter \\
    - a practical division to sub-tasks \\
    - implementations to some sub-tasks, along with ideas to improve them \\
    - requirements for the missing implementations \\
}

\fixme{ \\
    The research failed to meet original goals. Reasons: \\
    - difficulty underestimated \\
    - no previous knowledge of the subject matter \\
    - little expertise in relevant areas in the department \\
    - lack of instruction \\
    - workload more suitable for doctoral than MSc work \\
}

\fixme{ \\
    Difficulty in scoping, reasons: \\
    - broad area of research (broad expertise needed for any task) \\
    - no big picture when starting \\
    - difficulties understanding relations between topics and their relevancy \\
    - ideas wildly branching in different directions \\
    - no feasibility validation for ideas \\
    - objective not clearly defined \\
