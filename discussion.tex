% TODO: reflect on the work done; analyze the choices made etc. as objectively
% as possible

\fixme{The research failed to meet original goals. Reasons: \\
- difficulty underestimated \\
- no previous knowledge of the subject matter \\
- little expertise in relevant areas in the department \\
- lack of instruction \\
- workload more suitable for doctoral than MSc work \\
}

\fixme{
Difficulty in scoping, reasons: \\
- broad area of research (broad expertise needed for any task) \\
- no big picture when starting \\
- difficulties understanding relations between topics and their relevancy \\
- ideas wildly branching in different directions \\
- no feasibility validation for ideas \\
- objective not clearly defined \\
